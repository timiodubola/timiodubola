#### My name is Oluwatimilehin Odubola... I Build :construction_worker:, I Ship :rocket:  and Scale Products :chart_with_upwards_trend:.


I consider myself a "tech-people" person because in as much I love working on the technical side of things (I.e writhing codes and building systems), I also enjoy communicating with people and building communities. Presetently and in time past  I have lead and serverd as community manager/tech lead with various tech communities like Microsoft Student Partners, Data Science Nigeria, Google Developer Student Club.

If it's about the "codes"... check my repositoriesðŸ˜„. So, let's talk about me...aside punching my keyboard, I love playing the game of chess and reading books to get knowelge on different facets of life .
