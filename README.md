#### My name is Oluwatimilehin Odubola... I Build :construction_worker:, I Ship :rocket:  and Scale Products :chart_with_upwards_trend:.

A software engineer that loves creating web products and working with AWS. If you looking for your "swiss knife" nerdy 🤓 , **YOU** are definitely on the right page. I have worked on products from end-to-end, but inasmuch that I can fit in across various teams(Frontend, Backend, DevOps)...you find me most times working on server-side of things(Backend) or deployment(DevOps).

- 🔭 I’m currently building and maintaining productivity tools and products. [PageGloss](https://github.com/Odubolaoluwatimilehin/PageGloss) and PageWatch(launching soon):fire:.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate and work on open-source tools.
- ✍️ I love writing and creating tech content. Catch up with me at **"Tech and everything between"** in my monthly newsletter. Subscribe [📫](https://buttondown.email/Itz_timilehin)
- :grin: I consider myself a "tech-people" person because in as much I love working on the technical side of things (I.e writhing codes and building systems), I also enjoy communicating with people and building communities.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...aside from punching my keyboard, I love playing the game of chess and reading books to get knowledge on different facets of life .
